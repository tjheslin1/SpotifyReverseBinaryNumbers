# Spotify Reverse Binary Numbers

A teaching project for working through [Spotify's Reverse Binary Numbers puzzle](https://labs.spotify.com/puzzles/).

Students fill in the `BinaryReverser` class to makes the corresponding tests pass.
Optionally there are helpder methods in `SpotifyHelper` to aid those less familiar with Java.

```
/*
    Useful Methods:

    - SpotifyHelper.convertNumberToBinaryString(*a number*)
    - SpotifyHelper.reverseBinaryString(*a binary string*)
    - SpotifyHelper.convertBinaryStringToNumber(*another binary string*);
 */

static long reverseBinaryNumber(long number) {
    return 0L;
}
```


All methods are static so as to not enforce the concept of Object Orientation if not desired.

_Note that this project does not include the emailing of answers to Spotify for verification.
The verification comes from unit tests._
